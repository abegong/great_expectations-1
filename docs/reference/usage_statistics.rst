We use CDN fetch rates to get a sense of total community usage of Great Expectations. Specifically, we host images and style sheets on a public CDN and count the number of unique IPs from which resources are fetched.

Other than standard web request data, we donâ€™t collect any data data that could be used to identify individual users. You can suppress the images by changing ``static_images_dir`` in ``great_expectations/render/view/templates/top_navbar.j2``.

Please reach out `on Slack <https://greatexpectations.io/slack>`__ if you have any questions or comments.
